### Abstract
<p style="font-size:11pt">
The methodology of rehabilitation measures in a pandemic has several signifi cant features associated with the unpredictability and high rate of emergence of problems of high complexity, limited communication between the therapist and the patient, the need for high responsiveness of decision-making and their compliance, the scale of the process and the associated need to use scalable operating tools, etc. One of the most eff ective solutions in medical rehabilitation assistance is remote patient/personal-centered rehabilitation. It requires online telediagnostic tools, telemetry and interventions focused on the patient’s capabilities, developed Internet interaction, intelligent information technologies, and services. Patient/personal-centered rehabilitation also needs eff ective methods in the “Physical therapist – Patient – Multidisciplinary team” system, statistical processing of large volumes of data, etc. Therefore, along with the traditional means of rehabilitation, as part of the “Transdisciplinary intelligent information and analytical system for the rehabilitation processes support in a pandemic (TISP)” the Smart-system for remote support of rehabilitation activities and services appeared. Combined with intelligent remote biofeedback devices and eff ective miniature telediagnostics, telemetry and recovery devices, such systems hold great promise, as evidenced by world experience as well. Objective of the research was to develop a formal model, software implementation, and methodological foundations for the use of services of a remote patient/personal-centered Smart-system for providing medical rehabilitation assistance to patients in a pandemic, in particular, the new coronavirus disease COVID-19. The world modern and generally accepted defi nition of the concept of Telerehabilitation or E-rehabilitation is a complex of rehabilitation exercises and training programs that are provided to the patient remotely using telecommunication computer technologies, mainly at the outpatient stage of treatment. The rapid development of telerehabilitation in the world and the acquisition by this direction of medicine of transdisciplinary connections with various subject areas that go beyond the modern paradigm of E-health, led to the emergence of the most modern type of rehabilitation – Hybrid E-rehabilitation. This type of E-rehabilitation consists of a number of the following fundamental methods, approaches and technologies: telecommunication technologies, telemetry, embedded systems and miniature smart wearable devices, biofeedback, virtual personal assistants, methods, technologies and software artifi cial intelligence applications for big data processing. The formal model, software implementation, and methodological foundations for the use of services (UkrVectōrēs, vHealth) of a remote patient/personal-centered Smart-system for providing medical rehabilitation assistance to patients in a pandemic, in particular, the new coronavirus disease COVID-19, have been developed.
