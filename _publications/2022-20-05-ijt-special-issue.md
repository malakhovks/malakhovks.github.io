### Abstract
<p style="font-size:11pt">
One of the most effective solutions in medical rehabilitation assistance is remote patient / person-centered rehabilitation. Rehabilitation also needs effective methods for the “Physical therapist – Patient – Multidisciplinary team” system, including the statistical processing of large volumes of data. Therefore, along with the traditional means of rehabilitation, as part of the “Transdisciplinary intelligent information and analytical system for the rehabilitation processes support in a pandemic (TISP)” in this paper, we introduce and define: the basic concepts of the new hybrid e-rehabilitation notion and its fundamental foundations; the formalization concept of the new Smart-system for remote support of rehabilitation activities and services; and the methodological foundations for the use of services (UkrVectores and vHealth) of the remote Patient / Person-centered Smart-system. The software implementation of the services of the Smart-system has been developed.
