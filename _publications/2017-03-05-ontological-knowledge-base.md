**Abstract:**
<p style="font-size:11pt">
Creation of supporting complex applications for scientific research has always been the one of the key areas of computer science. The main features of the modern development of scientific research are the transdisciplinary research approach and deep of all stages of the life cycle of the statement and solution of scientific problems. The given paper considers theoretical and practical aspects of developing advanced integrated knowledge-oriented information systems and their components. Analysis of the existing scientific information systems and the synthesis of the general principles for developing “The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace” and its components are presented. The functional components of knowledge-oriented information system “The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace” are designed. The functional models and software implementation of the software subsystem for creation and use of ontological knowledge base for research fellow’s publications, as a part of personalized knowledge base of scientific researcher are discussed. Research in modern conditions of e-Science paradigm requires pooling scientific community and intensive exchange of research results that may be achieved through the use of scientific information systems. “The instrumental complex for scientific research workplace” allows solving problems of contructivization and formalization of knowledge representation, obtained during the research process and collective accomplices interaction.
