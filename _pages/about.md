## üß† Scientific Interests of Kyrylo S. Malakhov

Kyrylo S. Malakhov‚Äôs research is focused on **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly in the following areas:

* Semantic Web
* **Computational linguistics (NLP, NLU, NLI)**
* **Ontology engineering**
* **Digital health**
* **Hybrid e-rehabilitation / Telerehabilitation**
* Current Research Information System (CRIS)
* Research and Development Workstation Environment (RDWE)
* e-learning

A central focus of his work is the development and enhancement of **complex intelligent systems** that support the **full lifecycle of scientific research**, with an emphasis on their **practical applications in specific domains**.

### üß∞ Research & Development Workstation Environment (RDWE)

Malakhov is co-author of the experimental **RDWE system OntoChatGPT**, a complex knowledge production environment. Functional methods developed for this system include:

- **Automated generation of RDF/XML structures**  
  (multi-sets of RDF triples)

- **Ontology-driven natural language dialogue**  
  Integrates **large language models** such as:
  - ChatGPT
  - Gemma
  - Llama  
  With structured prompts to enhance dialog intelligence

- **Structured prompt methodology** for **meta-learning** in large language models  
  (particularly for ChatGPT)

### üè• Applied AI in Telerehabilitation

Malakhov is actively developing and implementing **comprehensive AI-driven information systems** for the **entire scientific research lifecycle** in the field of **physical and rehabilitation medicine**, specifically in **telerehabilitation**.

These efforts aim to bring **automation and intelligence** to research workflows and expand the use of **RDWE systems** in healthcare innovation.
